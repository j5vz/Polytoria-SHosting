# Polytoria Self-Hosting
Self server hosting for Polytoria. Very useful for testing executors, and etcetera. Send feedback on https://discord.gg/kZw5RnzY3u , the official Discord server for SynSploit and what this was made for.

1. Put the PolytoriaLauncher.exe in the same folder as your map.
2. Double click it.
3. The game should pop up immediately in a test environment or so.
